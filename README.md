# Zuri-Rock-Paper-Scissor-task

Most of us may have played rock paper scissors before. Rock Paper Scissors is often used as a fair selection method between two people or more in order to settle a dispute or make an unbiased group decision. This method is similar to flipping a coin, drawing straws, or throwing dice.
If someone is unfamiliar, a rock paper scissors game is considered a hand game between two or more players. Participants say "Rock, Paper, Scissors!" and then form their hands into the shape of a rock (a fist), a piece of paper (palm facing downward), or a pair of scissors (two fingers extended) in a simultaneous manner.

The rules of this game are simple:

Rule 1: Rock smashes scissors, so rock wins

Rule 2: Paper covers rock, so paper wins

Rule 3: Scissors cut paper, so scissors win
